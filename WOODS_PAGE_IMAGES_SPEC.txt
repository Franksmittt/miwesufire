WOODS PAGE – IMAGE SPECIFICATION FOR EACH WOOD SPECIES
================================================================================
Project: Miwesu Fire Wood (standalone-thermal)
Page: app/woods/[slug]/page.tsx – one page per wood species.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Images per wood species: 7
• Wood species (6 total): Geelhaak, Knoppiesdoring, Sekelbos, Snuifpeul, Mopane, Rooibos
• Total images to create: 6 × 7 = 42 images

You will create 7 images per wood. The same 7 “slots” (hero, the wood, the look, etc.) are used for every species; only the wood in the photo changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMAGE SLOTS – WHAT EACH IMAGE IS FOR & WHAT TO CREATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- IMAGE 1: HERO (slot index 0) ---
• Where it’s used: Full-width hero at top of the wood species page. Text overlay: wood name, scientific name, tagline.
• Suggested aspect ratio: 16:9 or 21:9 (wide, cinematic). Min usable: ~1320×600.
• What to create:
  A striking, wide shot that says “this wood / braai / firewood” and works with dark overlay. Options:
  – Stack of split logs of this species (identifiable by bark/colour) in good light, maybe with a braai or fire pit in the scene.
  – Close-up of a pile of this wood with shallow depth of field and warm, premium feel.
  – This wood burning in a braai or fire, flames/coals visible, atmospheric.
  Keep the lower third relatively uncluttered so overlay text stays readable.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] braai wood – premium firewood Gauteng”

--- IMAGE 2: THE WOOD – APPEARANCE & GRAIN (slot index 1) ---
• Where it’s used: “The wood” section, next to the intro paragraph (large 4:3 panel).
• Suggested aspect ratio: 4:3. Suggested size: ~800×600.
• What to create:
  Shows the wood’s identity: grain, colour, and overall look. Options:
  – Split face of a log so heartwood and sapwood (lighter outer band) are visible.
  – Several pieces of this species arranged to show colour variation and grain.
  – Close-up of the distinctive feature (e.g. Geelhaak’s golden/russet tone, Knoppiesdoring’s dark heartwood, Sekelbos two-tone).
  Should feel “product shot” but natural – this is the “appearance and grain” shot.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] hardwood – appearance and grain”

--- IMAGE 3: THE LOOK – WIDE (slot index 2) ---
• Where it’s used: “The look” section – main large image (wide rectangle) above the bark/heartwood/sapwood text cards.
• Suggested aspect ratio: 16:10. Suggested size: ~800×500 or 960×600.
• What to create:
  Broader view of “the look” of this wood – bark, shape, and how it presents in real use. Options:
  – Logs of this species with bark visible (showing bark texture and shape).
  – A small stack or row of logs so bark, colour, and form are clear.
  – Mix of round and split pieces to show both bark and heartwood/sapwood.
  Complements the “Bark & shape” and “Heartwood & sapwood” copy next to it.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] firewood – the look”

--- IMAGE 4: THE BURN – HOW IT PERFORMS (slot index 3) ---
• Where it’s used: “The burn” section – wide mood image with “How it performs” label overlay.
• Suggested aspect ratio: 2:1. Suggested size: ~800×400 or 1000×500.
• What to create:
  This wood actually burning. Options:
  – Flames and/or coals of this wood in a braai or fire pit (no other wood types in frame if possible).
  – Close-up of glowing coals or active flame so the “burn” is the focus.
  – Braai with meat or grill optional; focus should be on fire/coals from this species.
  Warm, inviting, slightly atmospheric; works with a dark gradient overlay at the bottom.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] – how it burns, braai wood”

--- IMAGE 5: BARK / HEARTWOOD CLOSE-UP (slot index 4) ---
• Where it’s used: (a) “The look” section – smaller panel next to the wide “look” image, (b) First image in the 3-image gallery strip at the bottom.
• Suggested aspect ratio: 4:3 for the panel; also cropped to square in gallery. So either 4:3 or 1:1 works; 4:3 is safe.
• Suggested size: ~400×300 or 600×450.
• What to create:
  Detail shot: bark and/or the transition from bark to heartwood. Options:
  – Close-up of bark texture and colour typical of this species.
  – End grain or split face showing heartwood (and sapwood if visible).
  – One or two pieces that clearly show “bark and heartwood” for quick ID.
  This slot is reused in the gallery, so a shot that still looks good when cropped square is ideal.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] – bark and heartwood” / “[Wood name] firewood gallery”

--- IMAGE 6: GALLERY – BRAAI WOOD (slot index 5) ---
• Where it’s used: Second image in the 3-image gallery strip (all displayed as squares).
• Suggested aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) preferred; will be cropped to square if not.
• Suggested size: ~400×400 or 600×600.
• What to create:
  A second strong shot of this wood – different angle or context from images 4 and 5. Options:
  – Stack or pile of this wood (lifestyle / “ready for braai”).
  – Hand or tool near the wood (e.g. placing a log, lighting) to add context.
  – Same wood in a bag or at a delivery-style setup if that fits the brand.
  Should read clearly as “[Wood name] braai wood” at a glance.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] braai wood”

--- IMAGE 7: GALLERY – PREMIUM FIREWOOD (slot index 6) ---
• Where it’s used: Third image in the 3-image gallery strip (square).
• Suggested aspect ratio: 1:1. Suggested size: ~400×400 or 600×600.
• What to create:
  Third variation – again clearly this species. Options:
  – Another detail (grain, colour, split) that hasn’t been covered yet.
  – Wood in a fireplace or fire pit (if different from image 4).
  – Clean product-style shot: neat stack or single log on a neutral surface.
  Round off the gallery with a “premium firewood” feel.
• Alt text used: “[Wood name] premium firewood Gauteng”

RECOMMENDED DIMENSIONS SUMMARY (for your reference)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Hero:           1320×600  (or 1920×810 for 16:9)
2. The wood:       800×600   (4:3)
3. The look wide:  960×600   (16:10) or 800×500
4. The burn:       800×400   (2:1) or 1000×500
5. Bark/heartwood: 400×300   (4:3) or 600×450 – also used as gallery square
6. Gallery 2:      400×400   (1:1) or 600×600
7. Gallery 3:      400×400   (1:1) or 600×600

Using 1200px or 1600px on the long side is fine for retina; the site will scale down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PER-WOOD CHECKLIST (6 species × 7 images = 42 images)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create 7 images for each species. Naming suggestion: [slug]-[slot].jpg (e.g. geelhaak-0.jpg … geelhaak-6.jpg).

[ ] Geelhaak (Blue Thorn)      – 7 images  (hero, wood, look, burn, bark, gallery2, gallery3)
[ ] Knoppiesdoring (Knob Thorn) – 7 images
[ ] Sekelbos (Sickle Bush)     – 7 images
[ ] Snuifpeul (Scented-pod)    – 7 images
[ ] Mopane                     – 7 images
[ ] Rooibos                    – 7 images

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES FOR CREATING THE IMAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consistency: Keep lighting and style (e.g. warm, natural, premium) similar across all 42 so the site feels cohesive.
• Species accuracy: Each set of 7 should clearly show one species only – bark, colour, and grain should match the copy in lib/woods.ts (e.g. Geelhaak peeling yellowish bark and golden–russet heartwood; Knoppiesdoring knobbly bark and very dark heartwood; Sekelbos two-tone; etc.).
• Once you have the files, we can wire them into the app (e.g. under /public/woods/[slug]/ or similar) and replace the current picsum placeholder URLs in app/woods/[slug]/page.tsx with your image paths.
