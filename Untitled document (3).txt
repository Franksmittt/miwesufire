Brand safety and suitability
​
Brand safety: Meta applies brand safety to all ads through our Community Standards and Monetization Policies, keeping your ads away from objectionable content.
Brand suitability: In some cases, brands want more control over where ads can appear. Brand suitability filters or excludes specific topics or publishers. Keep in mind that using these controls can lower your reach and increase costs.
Inventory filters
​
We apply the default inventory filter unless you change it. Content that's excessively controversial or offensive is always excluded, regardless of what filter you choose.
