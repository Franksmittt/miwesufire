Strategic Market Dominance Report: Vaalpenskraal Braai Mix 2026
1. Executive Market Assessment and Strategic Imperative
The South African firewood market, specifically within the complex socio-economic landscape of the Gauteng province, operates at a volatile intersection of commodity economics, deep-seated cultural heritage, and intensifying consumer price sensitivity driven by macroeconomic inflationary pressures. The comprehensive analysis of Vaalpenskraal Braai Mix’s current market positioning reveals a distinct and highly exploitable market anomaly: the brand possesses a massive, yet un-leveraged pricing advantage in a sector historically dominated by premium-priced competitors who rely on legacy branding rather than unit economic efficiency.
With a bulk offering of 500kg for R1,250—translating to a unit cost of R2.50 per kilogram—Vaalpenskraal is effectively undercutting the established market average of R4.20 to R5.42 per kilogram by approximately 40% to 54%.1 In standard economic theory, such a profound price disparity, particularly for a fungible commodity like biomass fuel, should result in immediate market clearing and absolute dominance. However, the requirement for this deep research plan, necessitated by the current campaign data, suggests that sales volume is not commensurate with this extraordinary value proposition.
This disconnect indicates the presence of a profound "Value-Trust Gap," a psychological phenomenon prevalent in South African e-commerce where extreme value is frequently misconstrued by consumers as a signal of high risk. Specifically, the consumer fears the risk of scams—rampant on platforms like Facebook Marketplace—or inferior product quality, such as wet, unseasoned, or "green" wood that smokes rather than burns.3 Therefore, the strategic imperative for 2026 is not to compete on price, as the price war has already been decisively won, but to systematically dismantle the trust barriers and technical inefficiencies that prevent this value from being recognized by the high-net-worth consumer.
1.1 The Macroeconomic Context: The 2026 "Braai Index" Pressure
As of the first quarter of 2026, the South African consumer is navigating a landscape of contradictory economic signals that directly impact disposable income allocation. While general food inflation has shown signs of moderation, the specific components of the "Braai Index"—a colloquial but critical measure of disposable income allocation for South African households—remain under severe pressure.5
Data from the Pietermaritzburg Equity Justice and Dignity (PMBEJD) group and various economic indices highlight a "share of wallet" crisis. While vegetable prices (potatoes, onions) have moderated, the protein components of the braai have surged. Beef prices have recorded year-on-year increases of over 20%, and boerewors has risen by approximately 11% due to supply chain constraints and biological challenges like Foot-and-Mouth Disease outbreaks.7 This creates a specific economic pressure point: as the cost of the food component of the braai increases, consumers are theoretically highly incentivized to seek savings on the fuel component to maintain their lifestyle.
However, the data suggests a counter-intuitive behavior where consumers, burnt by online scams and inconsistent quality from informal sellers, retreat to expensive, established retailers (paying R5.42/kg) rather than risking transactions with unknown bulk suppliers (at R2.50/kg). They are paying a "Trust Premium" of nearly 100%. This report outlines a comprehensive strategy to capture this premium by leveraging forensic data analysis, advanced geo-spatial targeting, and psychological trust architecture.
1.2 The Energy Security Pivot
Furthermore, the role of firewood in 2026 has transcended recreational cooking to become a component of essential energy security. With Eskom’s electricity tariffs increasing by approximately 12.74% for the 2025/2026 period, and municipal markups often pushing this higher, the cost of electric heating has become prohibitive for many households.9
Firewood represents a stable, inflation-proof energy source for winter home heating. A volume of 500kg is not merely a "braai supply"; it is a strategic winter stockpile sufficient to heat a standard suburban home for 6 to 8 weeks of winter evenings. The marketing narrative must therefore shift from discretionary "Braai Wood" to essential "Thermal Security," positioning the bulk purchase as a rational economic hedge against rising utility costs.
1.3 Forensic Data Audit of Current Operations
A rigorous examination of the provided campaign data files (Frank-Smit-Campaigns-Jan-11-2026-Fe-9-2026.csv) and audience reports (Audience.pdf) provides a granular view of the current operational inefficiencies. This forensic audit moves beyond surface-level metrics to understand the algorithmic behaviors currently draining profitability.
The Divergence of Ad Formats
The analysis reveals a stark divergence in performance efficiency between different advertising objectives, serving as a microcosm of broader digital marketing trends where user behavior on mobile platforms increasingly favors low-friction, asynchronous communication.
The most glaring inefficiency is observed in the "Call" campaigns. The data shows two ad sets optimizing for actions:click_to_call_native_call_placed 11:
* Ad Set A (R60 Daily Budget): Achieved 9 calls at a Cost Per Result (CPR) of R31.42.
* Ad Set B (R50 Daily Budget): Achieved only 2 calls at a catastrophic CPR of R115.14.
When aggregated, the weighted average cost to generate a single phone call is approximately R46.64. In the context of a R1,250 product, paying nearly R50 just for a conversation—before conversion—is mathematically inefficient. If the sales team closes 20% of these calls (a standard benchmark for cold inbound calls), the effective Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) balloons to R233.20. This effectively consumes nearly 19% of the gross revenue before factoring in Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), driver wages, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. This trajectory is unsustainable for a low-margin commodity business.
Conversely, the "Marketplace Listing Boost" campaign, which optimized for actions:onsite_conversion.messaging_conversation_started_7d, delivered results at a CPR of R11.11.11 This represents a 76% reduction in cost compared to the average call campaign and a 90% reduction compared to the worst-performing call ad set. The efficiency of the messaging objective lies in its alignment with modern user behavior; initiating a chat is a low-commitment action that allows the consumer to verify availability and legitimacy without the immediate social pressure or inconvenience of a synchronous voice conversation.
Geographic Leakage
The Audience.pdf document uncovers a critical failure in the current targeting configuration that is actively draining the advertising budget. The report lists the top cities by reach, revealing that Cape Town (6.8%), Durban (2.9%), and Port Elizabeth (2.9%) account for a significant portion of the audience.11
Collectively, this indicates that over 12% of the ad spend is being directed toward users in provinces that Vaalpenskraal does not service. This wastage is not merely a function of lost budget; it actively degrades the performance of the Meta advertising algorithm. Modern algorithmic bidding relies on finding patterns among converting users to optimize delivery. When the ad delivery system serves impressions to users in Cape Town who engage with the content (perhaps liking the low price) but cannot purchase, the algorithm receives a false positive signal.2 It then seeks out more users with similar profiles—likely more people in the Western Cape—creating a feedback loop of irrelevance.
The root cause of this leakage is almost certainly the default location setting on the Meta ad platform, which targets "People living in or recently in this location." Gauteng, being the economic hub of South Africa, sees massive transient traffic. A user who lives in Cape Town but visited Sandton for a meeting last week falls into the "recently in" bucket and will be served the ad after returning home. To crush competitors, Vaalpenskraal must implement a "Gauteng Fortress" strategy, utilizing strict exclusion lists to explicitly block all other eight provinces.
________________
2. Competitive Landscape and Pricing Architecture
To formulate a plan to crush competitors, one must first dissect the current market structure. The Gauteng firewood market is characterized by a bifurcation between "Premium Brands" that offer curated, single-species hardwoods at a premium, and "Informal/Bulk Sellers" that compete on price but suffer from trust deficits.
2.1 The Pricing Disparity and Value Proposition
A comparative analysis of the competitor data reveals the magnitude of Vaalpenskraal's pricing advantage.
* Rand Wood: The market leader in the premium segment positions its 60-bag (480kg) Sekelbos offering at R2,600, translating to roughly R5.42 per kilogram.1
* Joburg Firewood: This competitor prices its 64-bag (500kg) Hardwood load at R2,400, or R4.80 per kilogram.13
* Just Get Wood: Mid-tier competitors offer a "Double Bakkie Load" (644kg) for R2,240, working out to R3.48 per kilogram.
* Vaalpenskraal: The offer of 500kg for R1,250 results in a unit price of R2.50 per kilogram.3
This places Vaalpenskraal at a price point that is effectively 54% lower than the premium competitors and 28% lower than the mid-tier options. In a rational market, this price leadership would result in a monopoly. The fact that it has not indicates that the market is operating on "Lemon Market" principles (Akerlof), where information asymmetry causes buyers to distrust low prices, assuming that any offer significantly below the market average must be flawed (i.e., wet, green, or short-weighted wood).
2.2 Vulnerability Assessment of Key Competitors
Despite their higher prices, these competitors exhibit distinct strategic vulnerabilities that Vaalpenskraal can exploit.
Rand Wood and Firewood Factory (The Fragile Premium): These competitors are heavily exposed to supply chain volatility. Their reliance on imported Namibian hardwoods (Kameeldoring, Sekelbos) makes them vulnerable to transport cost fluctuations and border delays. Their marketing focuses intensely on specific species, creating a rigid demand structure. If they run out of Kameeldoring, they lose the sale. Vaalpenskraal’s "Braai Mix" model offers supply chain flexibility; by blending species, the product availability is more robust and immune to single-species shortages. Furthermore, their high price point makes them the first luxury to be cut from household budgets when inflation bites.2
Joburg Firewood (The Middleman Squeeze): This competitor’s strength is its SEO dominance and "Free Delivery" narrative. However, their reliance on "Red River Gum" (an invasive eucalyptus) as a primary hardwood opens a flank for attack regarding wood quality. Gum can be difficult to light and ash-heavy if not seasoned perfectly. Their complex tiered pricing (1 load vs. 2 loads vs. 3 loads) introduces decision fatigue. Vaalpenskraal’s simple "50 Bags, One Price" proposition cuts through this complexity.13
Facebook Marketplace Informals (The Trust Vacuum): The lowest tier of competition is the unverified seller on Marketplace. While they may match Vaalpenskraal’s price, they are plagued by the "Scam Narrative." Reports of sellers demanding eWallet deposits and never delivering are rampant. This is Vaalpenskraal’s greatest opportunity. By professionalizing the bulk offer with branded trucks, uniforms, and a strict "Cash on Delivery" (COD) policy, Vaalpenskraal can occupy the pricing lane of the informals while offering the trust assurance of the premium brands.4
________________
3. Product Strategy: The "Thermodynamic Blend" Pivot
The term "Braai Mix" currently serves as a generic descriptor that, in the mind of the skeptical consumer, often translates to "random leftovers." To crush competitors who sell single-species prestige woods like Kameeldoring, Vaalpenskraal must reframe the "Mix" from a compromise into a sophisticated, technical feature. This involves pivoting the narrative from cost-savings to "Thermodynamic Engineering."
3.1 Scientific Deconstruction of the Mix
A superior fire requires a sequence of thermal events: ignition, flame propagation, heat sustenance, and coal formation. Single-species fires often struggle with one of these phases. For instance, extremely dense hardwoods like Kameeldoring (Camel Thorn) and Mopani are notoriously difficult to ignite, often requiring significant kindling and patience due to their density and low volatile organic compound content.14 Conversely, lighter woods like Wattle burn too fast to form a lasting cooking base.
Vaalpenskraal must market the "Braai Mix" not as random wood, but as a curated ratio of Starter Fuels and Sustainer Fuels.
* The Accelerator (Bluegum/Wattle): These species, likely present in the mix, are marketed for their volatility and flame height. They provide the initial thermal shock required to warm the flue (in fireplaces) or create the initial bed of heat. Bluegum, derived from eucalyptus, ignites easily and burns with a crackling sound, creating atmosphere.16
* The Battery (Sekelbos/Hardwood): The denser components of the mix serve as the thermal battery. Sekelbos is renowned for its natural oils which enhance flavor and its yellow bark distinctiveness. It retains heat and forms the coals required for cooking or long-duration heating.14
By explicitly marketing this duality, Vaalpenskraal positions the product as a "Complete Fire System" rather than a bag of wood. The marketing copy shifts from "Cheap Wood" to "The Perfect Ratio: Fast Flames to Start, Hot Coals to Last." This neutralizes the single-species advantage of competitors by highlighting the practical difficulty of using only super-hardwoods.
3.2 Visual Differentiation
It is critical to visually distinguish these woods in advertising to prove the "Mix" is intentional.
* Sekelbos: Yellowish bark, often stripped, fibrous texture.
* Bluegum: Reddish/pinkish hue when split (Red Saligna) or pale cream (Blue Gum), smooth tight grain.
* Wattle: Often darker bark, slightly softer looking grain. By showing these distinct textures in close-up ads, the brand educates the consumer and builds authority.14
________________
4. Geo-Spatial Strategy: The "Gauteng Fortress"
The current data proves that broad targeting is bleeding budget. The "Crush" strategy relies on a "Gauteng Fortress" approach—a hyper-localized targeting protocol that eliminates wastage and focuses entirely on high-probability buyers.
4.1 Technical Exclusion Layering
The first step in the fortress strategy is the implementation of a Negative Geo-Fence. Ad platforms prioritize delivery to the cheapest available inventory, which is often found in less competitive, non-target regions if not restricted. Vaalpenskraal must explicitly exclude the eight non-Gauteng provinces (Western Cape, KZN, Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West, Northern Cape) at the campaign level. This forces the Meta algorithm to seek inventory strictly within the delivery footprint.
Furthermore, within Gauteng, "Red Lining" must be applied to areas with low probability of bulk storage capacity (e.g., CBD high-rise zones without service elevators) or areas where delivery logistics are dangerous or costly. This ensures that every impression is served to a user who not only wants the wood but can physically receive and pay for it.
4.2 The "Whale" Zones: Postal Code Targeting
To maximize the Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), targeting must focus on neighborhoods with high densities of freestanding homes, built-in braais, and fireplaces. These are the "Whale" zones where a R1,250 purchase is a casual transaction rather than a major financial decision. Analysis of high-income residential data and NetFlorist/eBucks delivery zones identifies specific postal codes as critical targets.18
Zone A: The "Old Money" Enclaves (Johannesburg North)
* Postal Codes: 2196 (Sandhurst, Hyde Park), 2191 (Bryanston), 2021 (Bryanston), 2193 (Parktown North), 2055 (Fourways).
* Persona: High-net-worth professionals and executives. Properties average R13m - R20m.20 Homes feature large entertainment areas and often multiple internal fireplaces.
* Psychological Trigger: Convenience & Cleanliness. They do not want to stack wood themselves. They fear dirt and insects. The "We Stack, You Relax" service is vital here.
* Ad Hook: "Don't let your fireplace go hungry. Premium mix delivered and stacked. No mess, no fuss."
Zone B: The "Estate Belt" (Centurion & Midrand)
* Postal Codes: 1692 (Midstream Estate), 0157 (Heritage Hill/Candlewoods), 0081 (Silver Lakes), 2062 (Lonehill).
* Persona: Family-oriented, security-conscious, affluent middle class. High density of built-in braais. Community-driven (word of mouth travels fast in estate WhatsApp groups).
* Psychological Trigger: Security & Volume. Drivers must have IDs for estate access. Bulk buying is common for weekend entertaining. Midstream is a "Whale" target due to its self-contained nature and high disposable income.21
* Ad Hook: "Midstream Delivery Special. Security-cleared drivers. 500kg for your weekend braai."
Zone C: The "Diplomatic" Zone (Pretoria East)
* Postal Codes: 0181 (Waterkloof, Waterkloof Ridge), 0081 (Lynnwood, Silver Lakes).
* Persona: Diplomats, government officials, established families. "Old Pretoria" money.
* Psychological Trigger: Status & Quality. The wood must be dry and clean.
* Ad Hook: "The Intelligent Choice for Waterkloof Winters. Certified Dry."
4.3 The "Exclude" List
Crucially, the campaign must exclude areas that generate low-quality leads or logistical nightmares.
* CBD Codes: 2000, 2001 (Johannesburg Central) - High density apartments, difficult delivery.
* Student Zones: 2006 (Braamfontein), 2092 (Auckland Park) - Transient population, low purchasing power.

5. Technical Campaign Architecture: The "Andromeda One" Protocol
The Meta advertising landscape in 2026 has shifted significantly with the "Andromeda" update, which favors broad targeting and AI-driven optimization over granular manual restrictions. The new algorithm uses advanced machine learning to match ads with users in real-time, analyzing millions of signals. However, for a local business with strict geographic limits, a pure "Advantage+" setup can be dangerous as it may expand beyond delivery capabilities.23
We will implement a Hybrid Andromeda Structure: leveraging Meta's AI for audience finding within a strictly geofenced perimeter.
5.1 Campaign Hierarchy
The account will be restructured into a single CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) campaign to maximize data density and learning.


Setting
	Recommendation
	Rationale
	Campaign Objective
	Leads
	Messaging (R11 CPR) vastly outperforms Calls (R46+ CPR).11
	Conversion Location
	Messaging Apps
	WhatsApp is the primary communication channel for SA consumers.26
	Performance Goal
	Maximize number of conversations
	We want volume of chats to initiate the sales script.
	Budget Strategy
	Daily Budget (R300 starting)
	Allows consistent pressure to exit the "Learning Phase" (requires ~50 conversions/week).
	Bid Strategy
	Highest Volume
	Formerly "Lowest Cost". Let Meta find the cheapest leads first.
	5.2 Ad Set Configuration
We will utilize two Ad Sets to balance broad reach with "Sniper" targeting.
Ad Set 1: The Gauteng Broad (Prospecting - 70% Budget)
* Location: Gauteng Province (Include).
* Exclusions: CRITICAL. Exclude all 8 other provinces. Set location to "People living in this location" to avoid the "Recently In" trap (business travelers).12
* Age: 28 - 65+ (Excluding students/entry-level renters).
* Gender: All (Braai is male-skewed, but home heating purchasing is often female-driven).
* Detailed Targeting: NONE. Leave this empty. This relies on the "Andromeda" algorithm to analyze the creative (wood images) and find interested users automatically. Broad targeting prevents CPM inflation.23
* Placements: Advantage+ Placements (Allow Meta to find cheaper inventory on Reels, Marketplace, and Feeds).
Ad Set 2: The Sniper (High Intent - 30% Budget)
* Location: Specific Postal Codes: 2196, 2191, 1692, 0181, 0081, 2055, 2021.
* Interests: "Braai," "Fireplace," "Garden design," "Outdoor living," "Weber," "Big Green Egg," "Woolworths Food."
* Rationale: This acts as a "safety net" to ensure we force delivery to the highest income areas even if the CPM is higher. It targets the "Whale Zones" identified in Section 4.
5.3 The "Andromeda" Creative Philosophy
In the 2026 Meta ecosystem, Creative is the new Targeting.25 The algorithm analyzes the content of the image/video to determine who to show it to.
* If we show a moisture meter reading 12%, the algorithm will find people interested in wood quality/technical specs.
* If we show a cozy fireplace with a dog, it finds home-heating seekers.
* If we show a roaring braai with steak, it finds social entertainers.
We must feed the algorithm distinct "Creative Hooks" to find different sub-segments of the market.
________________
6. Consumer Psychology and Trust Architecture
The "Value-Trust Gap" is the primary barrier to conversion. In the "Lemon Market" of South African firewood, the buyer assumes that the low price of R1,250 implies a hidden defect. To crush competitors, Vaalpenskraal must construct a "Trust Architecture" that visually and operationally disproves this assumption.
6.1 The "Anti-Scam" Operational Protocol
The most potent weapon against competitors is the method of payment. Scammers on Facebook Marketplace almost universally demand an "eWallet" or "Instant EFT" deposit before delivery to "secure the booking".4 They leverage urgency to extract cash and then vanish.
Vaalpenskraal must weaponize this by making "No Deposit Required" and "Cash/Card on Delivery" the headline features of the campaign. This completely de-risks the transaction for the buyer. It signals immense confidence in the product—implying, "We are so sure you will like this wood that we are willing to drive it to your house before you pay a cent." This reversal of risk is the strongest possible psychological trigger in a low-trust environment.
6.2 Visual Verification: The Moisture Meter Strategy
Claiming "Dry Wood" is no longer sufficient; every seller claims it. Vaalpenskraal must prove it. The use of a digital moisture meter in video creatives acts as an irrefutable scientific proof point.28
A video showing a moisture meter being driven into a split log and reading <15% serves two functions:
1. Educational: It teaches the customer that moisture content is the metric that matters (positioning Vaalpenskraal as the expert).
2. Verifiable: It provides objective data that counters the fear of "green" wood. This creates a "Trust Anchor." Even if a competitor claims "Seasoned Wood," unless they show the meter reading, their claim feels weaker by comparison.
6.3 The Service Layer: Stacking as a Value Multiplier
For the high-net-worth target market in Sandhurst or Midstream, the physical labor of moving 500kg of wood is a significant deterrent. Competitors often deliver "curbside," leaving the homeowner to move the wood.
Vaalpenskraal should explicitly market the "We Stack, You Relax" service. By integrating the labor of packing the wood into the garage or braai room into the price (or as a small value-add), the offer shifts from a "Product" (wood) to a "Solution" (hassle-free heating). This appeals directly to the time-poor, cash-rich demographic targeted in the "Whale Zones."

7. Creative Strategy & Image Generation Prompts
The visual language of the campaign must shift from "utilitarian" to "aspirational yet authentic." The trend for 2026 outdoor living is "Rugged Luxury"—a blend of comfort and nature.30
7.1 Detailed Image Generation Prompts (JSON)
The following JSON object contains photorealistic prompts optimized for Midjourney v6.1 to generate high-trust assets.

8. Operational Alignment and Execution Roadmap
Marketing makes promises; Operations keeps them. To support this campaign, the operational backend must be aligned with the "High Trust" promise.
8.1 The WhatsApp Funnel Strategy
Since we are driving traffic to WhatsApp (as per the high-performing "Marketplace" campaign), the "First Response" is critical. In 2026, consumer patience is zero.
* Auto-Reply Configuration:
   * User Trigger: "I'm interested in the Braai Mix."
   * Auto-Reply: "Hi! Thanks for contacting Vaalpenskraal. 🔥 500kg Braai Mix is currently R1,250. We deliver to all Gauteng suburbs. No deposit needed. Payment on delivery. Reply with your Suburb to check the next delivery slot!"
* Rationale: This immediately answers the three biggest questions: Price, Area, and Scam Risk (No Deposit).
8.2 The "Theatre of Proof" Delivery Protocol
Drivers must be equipped with moisture meters (available for ~R300-R500). Upon delivery, the driver should proactively offer to split a log and test it in front of the customer.
* The Script: "Morning Ma'am. Before we stack, I just want to show you the moisture reading so you know it's dry."
* The Outcome: This "Theatre of Proof" turns a skeptical first-time buyer into a lifetime advocate who posts about the service on their HOA WhatsApp group, generating free viral reach in the estate.
8.3 Budgeting and Financial Modeling
Based on the forensic audit and projected efficiencies of the "Andromeda One" structure.


Metric
	Projection
	Rationale
	Total Monthly Budget
	R 9,000
	Approx. R300/day. Sufficient to exit learning phase.
	Target Cost Per Result (CPR)
	R 15.00
	Conservative estimate (Marketplace was R11.11).11
	Projected Leads
	600
	Messaging Conversations per month.
	Target Conversion Rate
	25%
	Standard for high-intent WhatsApp leads with COD offer.
	Projected Sales

	R 187,500
	150 * R1,250.
	ROAS
	20.8x
	Return on Ad Spend.
	Note: Even if performance degrades by 50% due to auction volatility, the ROAS remains above 10x, confirming the massive viability of the model.

9. Conclusion and Execution Checklist
Vaalpenskraal Braai Mix possesses the fundamental requirements for market dominance: a superior price point (R2.50/kg) and a scalable product. The barriers to growth have been self-inflicted: leaking budget to irrelevant geographies (Cape Town/KZN), utilizing inefficient ad formats (Calls), and failing to aggressively counter the market's trust deficit regarding cheap wood.
By erecting the "Gauteng Fortress" to seal budget leakage, pivoting to low-friction "Messaging" objectives, and deploying a "Trust Architecture" built on moisture verification and Cash-on-Delivery, Vaalpenskraal can effectively crush the premium competitors who rely on high margins and brand legacy.
Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours):
1. Stop all "Call" and "Traffic" campaigns immediately to stop the cash bleed.11
2. Create the new "Leads" (Messages) CBO campaign in Ads Manager.
3. Configure the "Gauteng Fortress" geo-targeting: Include Gauteng, Exclude all other 8 provinces. Set to "People Living In".12
4. Update WhatsApp Business Auto-Reply with the "No Deposit" trust signal.
5. Generate new creatives using the provided JSON prompts (Moisture Meter & Truck visuals).
6. Launch "Ad Set 1 (Broad)" and "Ad Set 2 (Sniper)" with R300/day budget.
This strategy transitions the brand from a "cheap marketplace option" to the "intelligent, verified choice" for the Gauteng homeowner, securing market share ahead of the critical 2026 winter season.
